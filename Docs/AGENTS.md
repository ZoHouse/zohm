# Zo Node: Agent Architecture

> **The Conscious House — AI handles logistics so humans can handle love.**

## Overview

A Zo Node operates through a tiered agent structure. Each "agent" is a role — human, AI-assisted, or fully automated — designed to remove operational friction so the humans in the space can focus on connection.
