# Zo World Design Principles

Foundational principles for how Zo World is visually designed, structured, and expressed across all interfaces. These rules ensure consistency, elegance, and alignment with industry standards (Apple Human Interface Guidelines, Material, and high-end spatial design logic).

---

# 1. Vibe First, Visuals Second

Zo design is about **feeling** before **seeing**.
Every screen must create emotional coherence: calm, clarity, and intention.
No clutter. No chaos. No noise.

---

# 2. Perfect Proportion (Apple Standard)

All components must follow:

* consistent 8pt spacing grid
* 2x or 3x balance for margins and padding
* size hierarchy rules (from Apple HIG)
* symmetrical grouping and alignment

If it feels "off by a few pixels," it is wrong.

---

# 3. Harmony Over Decoration

UI elements should:

* be minimal
* have a single purpose
* never compete for attention
* never use unnecessary borders, shadows, or gradients

The world should feel **clean**, not busy.

---

# 4. One Interaction Per Screen

Every screen must answer:
**What is the one thing the user is meant to do here?**

If there are two primary actions, simplify.

---

# 5. Spatial Design, Not Flat UI

Zo World builds spatial awareness through:

* depth layers
* motion gradients
* parallax
* map-first navigation
* environment-based storytelling

Interfaces must feel alive and dimensional.

---

# 6. Motion With Meaning

Animations must:

* communicate state change
* guide attention
* never distract
* follow easing standards (Apple: cubic-bezier smooth)

Speed: 180–250ms for micro interactions.

---

# 7. Avatar + Identity Centered

Identity is sacred in Zo World.
Every design surface should:

* make the citizen feel seen
* show avatar/pfp with respect
* never crop or distort identity markers

---

# 8. Map Is A Living Interface

The map must always:

* be clean and readable
* avoid overcrowded markers
* separate events, nodes, and quests cleanly
* show proportional scaling
* use iconography that is globally understood

---

# 9. Minimal Color, Maximum Meaning

Zo uses:

* a neutral base palette
* a single accent color per function (vibe, quest, node)
* no rainbow gradients

Color signals meaning, not decoration.

---

# 10. Typography: Calm, Clear, Consistent

Rules:

* 3 font sizes max per screen
* 2 weights max (regular + semi bold)
* zero decorative fonts
* tight leading and consistent letter spacing

Typography must feel modern and quiet.

---

# 11. Avoid Overlapping Elements

Absolute rule:
**Components must never overlap unless designed to.**

This is the number one place where AI-generated UI breaks.
Ensure:

* Z-index logic is predictable
* mobile responsive rules are explicit
* flexbox alignments are intentional
* padding is never negative

---

# 12. Strict Responsive Rules

Every component must:

* scale from 320px → 1920px
* break into mobile/tablet/desktop layouts properly
* avoid stretched images
* maintain gutters and margins

Test mobile first.

---

# 13. Component Library Canon

We maintain a strict component canon:

* Buttons
* Cards
* Inputs
* Sheets / Modals
* Map Markers
* Overlays
* Avatars
* Headers

The AI must only use approved components.
If new components are needed, add to canon first.

---

# 14. No Visual Noise

Avoid:

* unnecessary lines
* unneeded labels
* redundant icons
* excessive color
* too many shapes

Design is subtraction.

---

# 15. Everything Must Feel Premium

Zo World must feel:

* world class
* intentional
* aesthetic
* modern
* timeless

The standard is Apple quality.
Nothing less.

---

# 16. Consistency Creates Trust

Users must instantly understand:

* where things are
* how they behave
* what to do next

Consistency across screens creates flow.

---

# 17. Accessibility Is Non-Negotiable

Rules:

* color contrast AA minimum
* font sizes accessible
* tap targets 44px minimum
* clear voiceover labels

Everyone must be able to experience Zo.

---

# 18. Don't Break the Vibe

Design should never:

* feel corporate
* feel chaotic
* feel generic
* feel cheap

Everything must feel aligned.
Everything must feel like Zo.

---

# 19. Aesthetic Performance

Design must load fast:

* lightweight components
* compressed assets
* lazy loaded images and maps

Beauty must not cost performance.

---

# 20. Design for the Synced Layer

Every visual moment should:

* guide citizens into clarity
* reduce cognitive load
* create a sense of presence
* help them connect with their best timeline

Design is not just visual. It is consciousness shaping.
