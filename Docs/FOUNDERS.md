## Who We Are

**Zo Founders Network** is the global infrastructure for founders—physical spaces, community, and capital designed to help entrepreneurs build faster and with less friction.

### The Three Pillars

| 🏠 ZO HOUSES | 🚀 ZO ACCELERATOR | 💰 ZO CAPITAL |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Curated founder residencies in startup hubs | Always-on support for builders at any stage | Pre-seed investment for network founders |

### Our Story

Zo World began 12+ years ago with **Zostel**—India's largest backpacker hostel network. What started as places for travelers became gathering points for founders on a journey to build something meaningful.

We noticed patterns. The best ideas emerged from chance encounters. The strongest teams formed over late-night conversations. The most successful founders weren't just building companies—they were designing lives.

**Zo Founders Network is the intentional evolution: purpose-built infrastructure for the founder journey.**

### The Global Ecosystem

## Why It Matters

### The Problem
Building a startup is lonely. Founders face isolation, friction, and scarcity of quality peers.

### Our Thesis
> **The best companies are built by founders who design their lives, not just their products.**

**Why Physical Matters:**
-   **Digital**: Scheduled calls, anonymous profiles, transactional.
-   **Physical**: Serendipitous conversations, real identity, deep friendships.

### Proof Points
-   **Demand**: 800+ applicants for 12 residency spots.
-   **Economics**: EBITDA positive in Q1.
-   **Scalability**: 60% reduction in ops overhead via AI.
