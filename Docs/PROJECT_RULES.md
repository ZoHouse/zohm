# Zo World Project Rules

Foundational rules for how the Zo World project is built, designed, coded, communicated, and maintained. These govern both human and AI contributors.

---

# 1. Purpose of the Project

Zo World exists to build a Life Design Simulation Engine that helps people live consciously, creatively, and in sync with their highest timeline.

Every decision in product, engineering, design, community, and operations must map back to this core purpose.

---

# 2. Clarity Over Complexity

All communication, code, design, and documentation must remain simple, clear, and free of unnecessary abstraction.

If something can be explained simply, it must be.
If something can be built simply, it must be.

---

# 3. Lore Is Law

The Zo Protocol Lore is not fiction.
It is the operating ontology of the entire project.

All features must:

* respect the worldview
* support the simulation model
* reinforce alignment, flow, and synchronicity
* never contradict the system's philosophy

---

# 4. Reality Is Programmable

Every product decision must reflect the principle that reality is a dynamic, programmable, co-creative environment.

The project should:

* introduce intentional choice
* reduce noise
* increase coherence
* support identity evolution

---

# 5. Build Only What Strengthens the Engine

Zo World is made of:

* Vibe Score
* Quests
* Nodes
* Citizens
* Map Interface
* Narrative Engine

Any new feature must strengthen at least one of these.
If it does not, it is not built.

---

# 6. One Source of Truth

No duplicate logic.
No duplicated data.
No shadow tables.
No split state.

Each concept has a single canonical place:

* Identity → ZO API
* App state → Supabase
* Simulation logic → Engine modules
* Lore → Lore doc
* Rules → this file

---

# 7. Everything Generates Signal

Every interaction by a citizen must produce a signal:

* quest submissions
* map movements
* event attendance
* time spent in nodes
* creative outputs
* social interactions

Signals flow into the engine, and the engine updates the simulation.

---

# 8. We Build for Humans, with AI

The project follows a strict Human + AI pairing philosophy:

* Humans set direction and approve critical paths
* AI performs safe local edits and fast iteration
* Humans oversee identity, culture, design, and architecture
* AI never merges protected changes

---

# 9. All Code Paths Must Be Reversible

Migrations must have down scripts.
State changes must have rollbacks.
API changes must support fallback behavior.

No irreversible actions.

---

# 10. The Map Is the Home Screen of Reality

Map interactions are not UI actions.
They are reality interactions.

The map must always:

* feel alive
* reflect real-time state
* connect citizens to nodes
* surface quests
* show the pulse of the city

---

# 11. Citizens Come First

All features must prioritize:

* clarity
* ease of use
* delight
* self-expression
* progress
* alignment

There is no world without citizens.

---

# 12. Openness by Default

Documentation, architecture, and flows must be:

* transparent
* well-documented
* accessible to new contributors

Clarity is a growth amplifier.

---

# 13. Simulation Integrity Above All

We avoid:

* hacks
* broken flows
* untracked state transitions
* silent failures
* accidental forks in narrative logic

The simulation must always remain coherent.

---

# 14. Keep Magic Alive

Every interaction should feel:

* meaningful
* alive
* immersive
* aesthetic
* intentional

We are building culture, not just code.

---

# 15. Ship Fast, Ship Clean

We prioritize momentum but never at the cost of:

* stability
* clarity
* reversibility
* simulation integrity

Fast iteration, clean architecture.

---

# 16. Protect the Vibe

No toxic behavior.
No low-agency decisions.
No chaos.
No rushing without intention.

Everyone working on Zo World must maintain resonance with the mission, or step back until they do.

---

# 17. Everything is a Node

When in doubt, structure new experiences as:

* Nodes
* Quests
* Events
* Signals
* State transitions

Do not invent new primitives casually.

---

# 18. Documentation Is a Feature

If something is not documented, it does not exist.
If something is not versioned, it is not real.

---

# 19. We Honor the Aesthetic

The identity of Zo World is aesthetic coherence:

* clean
* minimal
* intentional
* symbolic

Design is not decoration. Design is reality signaling.

---

# 20. Build the Future, Not the Past

Everything we build must:

* scale to millions
* support mobile, AR, AI, and mixed reality
* align with the future of culture
* push humans into higher agency

We do not build legacy systems.

---

# 21. Zo World Must Feel Alive

The product must:

* adapt
* evolve
* respond
* mirror
* guide

Users must feel the world noticing them.

---

# 22. Be Precise, Be Playful

Architecture must be strict.
Expression must be free.

This balance is sacred.

---

# 23. Code as Craft

We do not ship sloppy code.
We do not ship messy architectures.
We do not ship broken experiences.

We craft.

---

# 24. No Ego, Only Evolution

We do not defend bad decisions.
We do not cling to old patterns.
We evolve with the system.

---

# 25. Build Toward the Synced Layer

Everything must guide citizens toward:

* clarity
* intention
* flow
* purpose
* alignment
* synchronicity

The Synced Layer is the destination.
