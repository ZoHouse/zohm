# Zo House Franchise & Standards

> **The blueprint for the physical infrastructure of the Zo Network.**

---

## 1. The Core Zo House Principle

A Zo House is **not** a co-living space, not a co-working hub, and not a retreat centre.

It is a **Life Design System** — a productised environment where people intentionally design their work, relationships, routines, and identity.

Every Zo House must preserve three sacred pillars:

1.  **Culture**: The rituals, values, cadence, and collective behavior that shape the lived experience.
2.  **Vibes**: The emotional temperature of the house — energy, flow, harmony, human chemistry.
3.  **Unit Economics**: Every Zo House must be operationally stable and EBITDA-positive.

These three define whether a Zo House is functioning at peak performance.

## 2. The Zo Network Architecture

There are only two types of nodes in the Zo ecosystem.

### A. Zo House (Full Node)

A complete **Life Design System**. This is the core product.

**Minimum Standards:**
-   Minimum 6 fully livable rooms
-   All rooms must have private washrooms
-   Cohort living (70% capacity)
-   Premium stays (30% capacity)
-   Event programming engine
-   Studio + creator zones
-   AI Ops, tasking, and visibility
-   Rituals + Life Design cadence
-   Strong operator + Entrepreneur-in-Residence (EIR)

### B. Zo Node (Light Node)

A lighter extension that runs the culture but not the full Living OS.

-   Community hub or Event space
-   Rituals + culture blocks
-   Partner-operated
-   Optional short stays

*Light nodes extend the network without replicating full Zo density.*

The system builds:

*This is the intentional living layer for the next generation.*
