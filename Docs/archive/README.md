# Archived Documentation

This folder contains documentation that is no longer actively maintained but kept for historical reference.

---

## Why Archive?

Documents are archived when:
- Replaced by better documentation
- Feature deprecated or removed
- Implementation details changed significantly
- Information consolidated into other docs

---

## Archived Files

## Using Archived Docs

**When to reference**:
- Understanding historical decisions
- Migrating old code
- Comparing old vs new approaches

**When NOT to reference**:
- New feature implementation (use current docs)
- API integration (use `API_CONTRACTS.md`)
- Architecture decisions (use `ARCHITECTURE.md`)

---

## Cleanup Policy

- Keep archived docs for 6 months minimum
- After 6 months, evaluate for permanent deletion
- If referenced by git history or issues, keep indefinitely
- Compress very old docs into single "historical context" file
