## 📊 Database Queries for Verification

SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 'did:privy:YOUR_ID';

-- By email
SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = 'user@example.com';

-- By wallet
SELECT u.* FROM users u
JOIN user_wallets uw ON u.id = uw.user_id
WHERE uw.address = '0xYOUR_ADDRESS';
```

### Check User's Wallets:

SELECT * FROM user_wallets WHERE user_id = 'did:privy:YOUR_ID';
```

### Check Auth Methods:
```sql
SELECT * FROM user_auth_methods WHERE user_id = 'did:privy:YOUR_ID';

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Login button not appearing"
- Check browser console for errors

- Refresh page

### Issue: "Onboarding not showing after login"
- Check if user already has profile in database
- Look for console logs: "📝 Onboarding required"
- Verify `onboarding_completed` is `false` in database

### Issue: "Profile not saving"
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify Supabase connection
- Check `users` table has correct columns
- Look for error in `upsertUserFromPrivy` function

### Issue: "Wallet address not showing"
