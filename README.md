# Zo World

> **"This is the craziest human coordination layer we are building... serious emergence taking place."**

Zo World is a platform designed to facilitate high-trust human coordination through verifying real-world identity, reputation, and localized community governance. It bridges the digital and physical worlds, empowering "Citizens" to unlock specialized access to events, spaces, and opportunities based on their contributions and "Vibe".

## 📚 Documentation

The documentation for Zo World is being actively built to support this vision.

- **[Documentation Index & Roadmap](./Docs/INDEX.md)**: The master list of all systems, features, and guides we are building. Start here to navigate the project.
- **[System Flows](./Docs/SYSTEM_FLOWS.md)**: Detailed technical breakdowns of current key user flows (Auth, Events, Vibe Checks).
- **[Archive](./Docs/archive/)**: Older documentation (Jan 2026 and prior) for reference.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18+)
- pnpm

### Development
```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start development server
pnpm dev
```
Access the web app at `http://localhost:3000`.

## 🏗️ Project Structure

- **`apps/web`**: The main Next.js application (Frontend + API Routes).
- **`packages`**: Shared internal packages (UI kit, ESLint config, TypeScript config).
- **`Docs`**: Project documentation central.
